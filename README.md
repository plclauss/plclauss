- 👋 Hi, I’m Paul W. Clauss II (@plclauss)

- 👀 I’m interested in music; art; crafts, like crochet; outdoor activities such as camping, paddleboarding, and kayaking; reading; and--above all--self-care, growth, and
positivity! (And, of course, programming and computer science included.)

- 🌱 I’m currently studying Electrical Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, and taking various courses on Python, C, HTML, CSS, and JS; I hope to get certifications
related to these languages in the near future. I am also always looking for new information in the world of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, specifically in relation to
the underlying moral/ethical issues inherited from the creation of AI. More importantly, however, I am learning how to be healthier, mentally and physically.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects involving website creation, frontend or backend. This in addition to maintaining my skills in Python and C, whatever that may be--
either open-source coding, or smaller projects on the side.

Stay safe, and be healthy and happy :)
